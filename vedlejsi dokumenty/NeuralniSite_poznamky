:10 < beach> "Thus, there are no known obstacles to copying, using, and modifying SBCL freely, as long as copyright notices of MIT, Symbolics, Xerox 
               and Gerd Moellmann are retained."


11:07 < igam> Nope: It is open source / free software, with a permissive license.
11:07 < igam> SBCL is free software, provided as is, with absolutely no warranty. It is mostly in the public domain; some portions are provided under 
              BSD-style licenses.  See the CREDITS and COPYING files in the distribution for more information.
11:13 < razzy> igam: so programmers who write in lisp like to use LLGPL :]
11:13 < igam> Not all of them. I use AGPL3.
11:13 < igam> I feel that more lispers prefer MIT/BSD than GPL.
11:13 < jackdaniel> many libraries are licensed with BSD, some with lgplv2 etc
11:15 < razzy> igam: jackdaniel: thank you :]
11:15 < igam> On principles, I think that if you've been paid by the public to develop the free software (eg. you're a university professor), then of 
course MIT or BSD should be the license. But if not, if it's your own investment, then GPL (or AGPL nowadays) should be your default 
              license.
11:16 -!- rszeno [~rszeno@79.114.6.78] has quit [Quit: Leaving.]
11:16 < igam> Until no capitalist corporation remains, then you will be able to just ignore any notion of license and copyright just like in the time of 
              minstrels and troubadours.
11:16 < razzy> :]]]
11:19 < razzy> igam: Minstrels had some copywright issues, I believe :]
